### Context: 

üìÜ My pet routine was thought through my need to be able to organize my pet's important things in one place.

With the app you can create reminders, add tasks and your pet's data. With this you have information that may be necessary for the day-to-day with your pet. My Daily Pet came to make your day-to-day life easier.
